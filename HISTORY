05.01.02  /  v0.0.3
* fixed bug w/long ip address searches in the ip search and
  historical ip search scripts
* fixed minor bug w/signal indicator code
* added support for up 50 uBRs
* eliminated errors attributed to unused/unconfigured ubrs
* removed several non-standard command line switches (java binary)
* added support for user/pass as well as plain password logins
* updated documentation (read this if you've had any installation issues)
* added word .doc and .html versions of the new (end)users guide

04.16.02  /  v0.0.2a
* fixed typo in the flaplist script
* scrapped and rewrote if/then statements to determine signal
  graphic to use
* Created self serve cgi that uses the HTTP_REFERER cgi
  envioriment variable and does an ipsearch using that
  address and then passes the modem the ip is behind to
  a customer oriented simple language pass/fail modem
  search. If the ip isn't found behind any monitored
  modems it will display an error w/the ip address.
  This doesn't work behind cable/dsl routers, yet.
  Also created transparent pass/fail graphics for this.
* Went over all the scripts and cleaned up my code.
  (changes to cmsearch, modemw, cmt, ipsearch, hips, etc)
* Updated documentation
